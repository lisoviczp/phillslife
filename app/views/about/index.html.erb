i made this site in ruby on rails to post everything that i find cool from pictures to articles to music.
</br></br> 
i was born and raised in glen ridge, nj and i graduated from washington&lee university in may 2013. i have degrees in both computer science and business administration from w&l, and i just finished a course in back end web development from a fantastic company called general assembly. i've been introduced to the tech community in nyc through general assembly and i couldn't be more excited.
<br></br>
i currently work at investment technology group in the analytics division, where i query and manipulate data to find trading performance trends in the stock market.
<br></br>
i'm an avid new york jets fan (which is pretty unfortunate these days) and i love to produce electronic music in my free time using ableton live.
