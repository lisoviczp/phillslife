i was born and raised in glen ridge, nj and i graduated from washington&lee university in may 2013. i have degrees in both computer science and business administration from w&l, and i just finished a course in back end web development from a fantastic company called general assembly. i've been introduced to the tech community in nyc through general assembly and i couldn't be more excited to get involved.
